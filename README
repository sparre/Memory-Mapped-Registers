Memory-Mapped Registers [1]
===========================

An example of how to use a generic package to ensure a consistent
implementation of memory-mapped registers.

This is the result of a chat I've had with "Visaoni" on the #Ada IRC channel
on FreeNode.


Included tests
--------------

The repository comes with four test cases:

1) 'execute-plain' - checks that the "plain" example of how to access a
   memory-mapped register works (we cheat and actually write to memory
   allocated to a string variable in the example).

2) 'execute-packaged_register' - checks that the example of how to access a
   memory-mapped register through the Memory_Mapped_Register package works (we
   cheat and actually write to memory allocated to a string variable in the
   example).

3) 'cyclomatic_complexity' - reports excessive cyclomatic complexities in the
   project sources.

4) 'unused_units' - warns about units which aren't compiled.
